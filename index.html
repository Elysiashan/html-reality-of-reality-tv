    <h1>Game Shows</h1>
    <h2>Big Brother</h2>
        <p>A group of contestants move into the Big Brother house and nominate 2-3 people each week to be evicted. These contestants are isolated from the outside world and are under constant surveillance by cameras. They must compete in 2 challenges each week to gain safety for the week and gain power in the game. One of the challenges is the Head of Household competition and the winner of that game gets full power of the week. They can nominate whoever they want for the block. The second challenge is called the Power of Veto and if a contestant that&rsquo;s on the block wins this competition, they get the power to take themselves off the running for eviction. If a contestant wins the competition that is not up for eviction, they have the power to take someone else off or leave the nominations the same. The HOH can then nominate someone else for eviction if someone takes themselves off. The contestants that aren&rsquo;t nominated can vote for who they want to leave and then the contestant who receives the majority votes leave the house.</p>
    <h2>Survivor</h2>
